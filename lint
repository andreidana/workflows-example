#ESLint run example

workflow "New workflow" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["ESLint"]
}
action "ESLint" {
  uses = "stefanoeb/eslint-action@master"
}
By default, it will run ESLint through all the files in the project. But you can also specify a glob of files on the args, just like ESLint:
workflow "New workflow" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["ESLint"]
}
action "ESLint" {
  uses = "stefanoeb/eslint-action@master"
  args = "index.js src/**.js"
}
